# FrontEnd TIE (Technical Interview Exercise)
 
## Instructions :
 
You will need to produce a single app page.

You must create a site with the theme of your choice.

You can use any framework you want but we recommend using SvelteKit or any JS framework.

You need to fetch any api to display some data (the api  need to be in the same theme as your global theme)

We should only build and run your back with the followings commands : 
`npm i`, `npm run dev` or `npm run build`  
or
`yarn`, `yarn start` or `yarn build`

We are looking to see your work method and your code logics.

The important part is how you code, so focus on making the code clean and respectful of the code standards, making it work is secondary.
